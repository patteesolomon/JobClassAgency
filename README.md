-Models
User - models/user.js
JobCard - models/cards.js

-Getting Started: 
sc1 - cloning here
sc2 - setup filebase
sc3 - link up the three applications
sc4 - push to your github
sc5 - Mongodb setup
sc6 - Know that Render might not work
sc7 - use this walkthrough on render for sites
link here - 
sc8 - rendering the page

-Unsolved Problems:
Getting certain objects to render and load on the front end.
 Preventing:
Cards display after search and even if it's 
solved the dom keeps showing errors.

Not all jobs are listed here.

-Features
1. This application will search up the results 
of whatever the user typed in and post the information
requested.
2. Any user can see the jobcards and delete them when requested. Add cards. View them and update the db. But only for now.
