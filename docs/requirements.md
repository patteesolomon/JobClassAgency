Project #3: The Full Stack MERN App
 

Attendance
We will not be having instruction on project days, but we do expect you to be in class to work on your project and most importantly get help from your instructional team. We will not be having Office Hours.

We will still have some instruction and other mandatory items during project week.

Project Details:
 
ðŸ”´ Mandatory to Pass:
MVP - Minimum Viable Product
For this project, you will be making another full CRUD app using the technologies outlined below.

A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React.
At least one model with full CRUD.
Include at least one of the following features:

Pull from a third party API - either client side with AJAX or server-side with an NPM

NPMs that work with an API: Twitter, Yelp, etc. Remember the Axios module can make API calls server side to any URL.
Have two models

Have two separate models that don't have to be related
 
Use a CSS framework like Skeleton  Links to an external site.or Bootstrap  Links to an external site.or BulmaLinks to an external site.
Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Render (backend) and GitHub Pages (frontend).
Use React Router
The project must include a README.md file with the following sections:

Introduction: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more 
screenshots.

Technologies Used: A list of all technologies, libraries, APIs, etc. used in the project.

Getting Started: Info on how to clone and start the app and link to the deployed app on GitHub Pages/Render.

Unsolved Problems: List any unsolved issues.
Future Enhancements: Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project.

Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.md file in your GitHub repo

Submission
You will submit the link to your Frontend repo. It SHOULD contain links to your back end repo, and both deployed apps.

Project Presentation
You will have 7 minutes to present and demonstrate the following:

Introduce your project by paraphrasing its README.
Click the link in the README to open the deployed app on Heroku.
Demonstrate your app's main features.
Share/discuss the following code (not line-by-line):

The main/central Mongoose model
Your "favorite" Express controller method
Your "favorite" React component
The client-side routing
Share the experience by answering the following:

What was your biggest challenge?
What are your key learnings/takeaways?
Following your presentation, there will be a brief Q & A period and optional instructor feedback.

At this stage of SEIR, being able to find the the answers to your development issues is of paramount importance.
Feel free to use all resources available and collaborate with others.
If you do seek assistance in Slack, explain the issue, include screenshots, and explain what you've done to solve the issue on your own.

 Links to an external site.Suggestions to Get Started
Donâ€™t get too caught up in too many awesome features â€“ simple is better. Favor fewer features that look/feel impressive over numerous clunky/sloppy features.
When implementing a feature, think through the steps that it takes in plain language first. If necessary, write and/or diagram the steps to help guide your coding.
Follow the steps we've done in class to implement features, beginning with the user's interaction, identifying the proper route, etc.
Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIâ€™s you use.

Write DRY code.
In a SPA, communication with the backend is via AJAX. Build RESTful APIs to CRUD your data entities (resources) and perform other functionality via AJAX. In a React app, those AJAX calls should be made from "service" modules, not components.
Be consistent with your code style.
Clearly name variables and functions - remember, variables are usually named as nouns and functions as verbs.
Write well-formatted HTML/CSS/JS. Properly formatting your code makes it more readable. Improperly formatted code infers sloppiness.
Comment your code where it makes sense. Most code is self-documenting, however, comments help explain complicated code.
No commented out code!
If you have any questions regarding these requirements, please feel free to contact your instructional team!
