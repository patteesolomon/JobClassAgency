Check and see if the data mentioned are even 
obtainable in any of the models
listed below the line (APIS)

After the data is extracted from "" site 
I need data from a site recommending options as to where 
to go from there

fetched data will detail a picture of said 
job and the archetype data that will be loaded
from the web. 

Archetypes(root nodes of the tree):

Soldier < --
Warden < --- 
Artist < ---- 
etc.. Base names like these^

a List will be formed from this 
to create the many paths that are taken to 
achieve these titles.

eg..
HSchool -> (trade)S||College -> Degree -> Degree II 

Baby steps come first.

These baby steps.

Now I create.

0. the test link Then input the jobname

1. api crud models

APIS =>
2 DB's (1 for acc data, 1 for job data that loads premade cards)

Searchable job finder for the after test
A video finder for the results screen = 
(api finder exists)

*Jobname Websearch = (api finder exists)->

algo->
-A phone number for the site information = 

-School names for obtaining the titles
for the full tree path = 

-Information from the alljobs.txt

1. Saving the data from the models db
in a mongo

2. Use two api for account data that searches 
for the second api's corresponding default job title
cards

3. Use component stylizing and grab Bulma

4. store the person's name and data as a data collection within a schema.

5. Find a way to (lookup and) edit the dataType array only specific to the person. on an online db

6. Find a way to store online db info for static 
names found in the alljobs.txt

-strech goals (these goals are too important)-

1. TypeScript
2. Built in testing
3. Ruby backend and then stylization 
4. Archetype info *Arc Tree algo->
5. Archetype artwork
6. GPT-(latest ver.)
to lookup the
best Jobsite info to make 
personalized job cards in 
a third api
